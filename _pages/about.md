I am a 3D Computer Vision Engineer at EcopiaAI. I work on processing 3D scenes for geometry representation and novel view synthesis. Prior to that, I received my Masters degree supervised by [Dr. Michael S. Brown](http://www.cse.yorku.ca/~mbrown/) and [Dr. Marcus A. Brubaker](https://mbrubake.github.io/) in YorkU CVIL Group. During my master's, I have been a [VISTA](https://vista.info.yorku.ca/) Master's member and scholarship recipient. During my master's I am honored to have worked for [Samsung AI Center - Toronto](https://research.samsung.com/aicenter_toronto) as a Machine Learning reseach intern. I have also worked as a research assistant for [MDA](https://mda.space/en/) in the Neural Image Compression for the Next-Generation Space Camera project.

Prior to my master's, I have completed my BSc at [Sharif University of Technology](https://en.sharif.edu/), Tehran, Iran.

My research area revolves around deep 3D computer vision, probabilistic generative models, and computational photography. 
More specifically, I am interested in modeling and formulating the underlying hidden principles in 2D and 3D image data by utilizing the power and expressiveness of state-of-the-art generative models and geometry inductive biases.
