I am a MSc student supervised by [Dr. Michael S. Brown](http://www.cse.yorku.ca/~mbrown/) and [Dr. Marcus A. Brubaker](https://mbrubake.github.io/). My research area revolves around deep probabilistic generative models, and computational photography. More specifically, I am interested in modeling and formulating the underlying hidden principles in 2D and 3D image data by utilizing the power and expressiveness of the state-of-the-art generative models.
