I am a Machine Learning Engineer with a focus on ML/DL applications in computer vision. During my most recent experience at [EcopiaTech](https://www.ecopiatech.com/), I worked on a wide range of deep learning applications in computer vision including 3D reconstruction, generative models, multi-view object detection, and representation learning. I also engaged in the integration of software engineering and operational tools to deploy models into production in both large-scale and resource-constrained environments.

I completed my Master's in Computer Science supervised by [Dr. Michael S. Brown](http://www.cse.yorku.ca/~mbrown/) and [Dr. Marcus A. Brubaker](https://mbrubake.github.io/) in YorkU CVIL Group, where I was a member and scholarship recipient of [VISTA](https://vista.info.yorku.ca/). During my Master's I worked for [Samsung AI Center - Toronto](https://research.samsung.com/aicenter_toronto) as a Machine Learning research intern on generative models for camera image noise modeling and contributed to the Next-Generation Space Camera project on Neural Image Compression as a machine learning research assistant at [MDA](https://mda.space/en/). Prior to my master's, I completed my BSc in Computer Engineering at [Sharif University of Technology](https://en.sharif.edu/), Tehran, Iran.

I'm keen on creating products to bring automation with a focus on computer vision applications. More specifically, I am interested in modeling and formulating the underlying hidden principles in 2D and 3D visual data by utilizing the power and expressiveness of state-of-the-art generative models and representation learning. 

I always enjoy connecting with new people, whether it's to explore collaboration opportunities, exchange ideas, or simply catch up on our daily experiences! If you'd like to chat, feel free to send me an email or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alimaleky/).
