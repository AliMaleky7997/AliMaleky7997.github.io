<p>I am a Machine Learning Engineer with a focus on ML/DL applications in computer vision. During my most recent experience at <a href="https://www.ecopiatech.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EcopiaTech</a>, I worked on a wide range of deep learning applications in computer vision including 3D reconstruction, generative models, multi-view object detection, and representation learning. I also engaged in the integration of software engineering and operational tools to deploy models into production in both large-scale and resource-constrained environments.</p>

<p>I completed my Master’s in Computer Science supervised by <a href="http://www.cse.yorku.ca/~mbrown/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr. Michael S. Brown</a> and <a href="https://mbrubake.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr. Marcus A. Brubaker</a> in YorkU CVIL Group, where I was a member and scholarship recipient of <a href="https://vista.info.yorku.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VISTA</a>. During my Master’s I worked for <a href="https://research.samsung.com/aicenter_toronto" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Samsung AI Center - Toronto</a> as a Machine Learning research intern on generative models for camera image noise modeling and contributed to the Next-Generation Space Camera project on Neural Image Compression as a machine learning research assistant at <a href="https://mda.space/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MDA</a>. Prior to my master’s, I completed my BSc in Computer Engineering at <a href="https://en.sharif.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sharif University of Technology</a>, Tehran, Iran.</p>

<p>I’m keen on creating products to bring automation with a focus on computer vision applications. More specifically, I am interested in modeling and formulating the underlying hidden principles in 2D and 3D visual data by utilizing the power and expressiveness of state-of-the-art generative models and representation learning.</p>

<p>I always enjoy connecting with new people, whether it’s to explore collaboration opportunities, exchange ideas, or simply catch up on our daily experiences!
